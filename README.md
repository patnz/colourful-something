## colourfulSomething

this is a pointless webpage built by yours truly

---
### why?

yes. i agree. 'why?' indeed. ummmmmmmm.. really good question! ummm.... practice? trying to build things with JavaScript and minimal HTML 

---
### what?

- click to generate random coloured blocks
- counter will reach zero and you will be asked to pick two colours
- click where prompted to close pop up
- draw a picture!
- left click colours target block with Colour 1
- right click colours target block with Colour 2

---
### code?

i have included some comments explaining some of the code used, so have a look at the .js file in the repo

---
### future plans?


- number of blocks generated to be dictated by viewport size
- middle-click makes blocks disappear
- more colour! could be a paint by numbers vibe?
- 'somewhere over the rainbow' soundtrack

### bonus 

try drawing a shape, like a square, and then resizing the window. woah yeah cool.
